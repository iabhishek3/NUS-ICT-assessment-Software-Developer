Let's get started on preparing you for designing and developing REST APIs!

### Key Concepts:

1. **HTTP Methods**:
   - **GET**: Retrieve data from a server.
   - **POST**: Submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
   - **PUT**: Update an existing resource with new data.
   - **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.
   - **PATCH**: Apply partial modifications to a resource.

2. **Resource Naming**:
   - Use nouns to represent resources (e.g., `/users`, `/products`).
   - Use plural nouns for collections (e.g., `/users` for a collection of users).
   - Use hierarchical naming for nested resources (e.g., `/users/{userId}/posts`).

3. **Commonly Used Status Codes**:
   - **200 OK**: The request was successful.
   - **201 Created**: A resource was successfully created.
   - **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to return.
   - **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to client error.
   - **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required and has failed.
   - **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
   - **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition.

4. **Versioning**:
   - Include the version in the URL (e.g., `/api/v1/users`) to manage changes in the API.

5. **API Documentation**:
   - Properly document endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and error messages for developers.
