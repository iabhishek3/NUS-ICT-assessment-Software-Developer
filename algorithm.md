Let's dive into a structured preparation for the software development skills required for the NUS ICT assessment, focusing on regex, pointers, arrays, hash tables, trees, and search/sorting algorithms.

 1. **Regular Expressions (Regex)**
   - Definition: A sequence of characters that forms a search pattern, often used for string searching and manipulation.
   - Key Concepts:
     - Anchors: `^` (start), `$` (end).
     - Character classes: `\d` (digit), `\w` (word character), `.` (any character), `\s` (whitespace).
     - Quantifiers: `*` (0 or more), `+` (1 or more), `{n,m}` (between n and m occurrences).
   - Common Use Cases:
     - Validating email addresses, phone numbers, dates.
     - Extracting specific patterns from text (e.g., URLs, postal codes).
   - Example:
     ```regex
     ^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$  // Validates a Social Security Number (SSN)
     ```

 2. Pointers (C/C++ Focus)
   - Definition: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
   - Key Concepts:
     - Pointer declaration: `int *ptr;`
     - Dereferencing: Access the value at the address: `*ptr`.
     - Pointer arithmetic: Navigate through memory (`ptr + 1` moves to the next memory location).
     - Null pointer: `nullptr` is used to initialize a pointer to nothing.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int var = 10;
     int *ptr = &var;  // ptr stores the address of var
     cout << *ptr;  // Outputs the value at the address, i.e., 10
     ```

 3. Arrays
   - Definition: A collection of elements (typically of the same data type) stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - Key Concepts:
     - Fixed size: Arrays in most languages have a fixed size, defined at the time of declaration.
     - Indexing: Elements are accessed by their index, starting from 0.
     - Multidimensional arrays: Arrays with more than one dimension, e.g., `int matrix[3][3];`.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
     cout << arr[2];  // Outputs 3
     ```

 4. Hash Tables (Hash Maps)
   - Definition: A data structure that stores key-value pairs, optimized for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion.
   - Key Concepts:
     - Hash function: Converts a key into an index in the table.
     - Collision handling: Techniques such as chaining or open addressing handle cases where two keys hash to the same index.
     - Time complexity: Average time complexity for operations is O(1).
   - Example (Python):
     ```python
     hash_map = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2}
     print(hash_map["apple"])  # Outputs 1
     ```

 5. Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
   - Definition: A hierarchical data structure where each node has a value, and links to two or more child nodes (in binary trees, each node has at most two children).
   - Binary Search Tree (BST): A type of binary tree where the left child is smaller than the parent, and the right child is larger.
   - Traversal methods:
     - In-order traversal (left, root, right) yields nodes in increasing order.
     - Pre-order traversal (root, left, right) visits nodes in depth-first order.
     - Post-order traversal (left, right, root).
   - Example (BST insert):
     ```cpp
     struct Node {
         int data;
         Node* left;
         Node* right;
     };
     
     Node* insert(Node* node, int data) {
         if (node == nullptr) {
             node = new Node();
             node->data = data;
             node->left = node->right = nullptr;
         } else if (data < node->data) {
             node->left = insert(node->left, data);
         } else {
             node->right = insert(node->right, data);
         }
         return node;
     }
     ```

 6. Search and Sorting Algorithms
   - Search Algorithms:
     - Linear Search: Search each element sequentially. Time complexity: O(n).
     - Binary Search: Efficient for sorted arrays; repeatedly divides the search space in half. Time complexity: O(log n).
   - Sorting Algorithms:
     - Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Time complexity: O(nÂ²).
     - Merge Sort: Divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array and merges sorted halves. Time complexity: O(n log n).
     - Quick Sort: Partition-based sort that works by selecting a pivot and recursively sorting subarrays. Time complexity: O(n log n).
   - Example (Binary Search):
     ```cpp
     int binarySearch(int arr[], int left, int right, int x) {
         while (left <= right) {
             int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
             if (arr[mid] == x) return mid;
             else if (arr[mid] < x) left = mid + 1;
             else right = mid - 1;
         }
         return -1;
     }
     ```

 Practical Tips:
- Regex: Practice by writing patterns to validate real-world inputs like emails, URLs, and phone numbers.
- Pointers: Understand memory management, pointer arithmetic, and how pointers interact with arrays and functions.
- Arrays: Focus on the time complexity of array operations and understanding how arrays are passed to functions.
- Hash Tables: Practice implementing a hash table from scratch using arrays and handling collisions.
- Trees: Implement basic operations on binary search trees (insertion, search, traversal).
- Search/Sort: Know the time complexities of various search and sort algorithms, and practice writing them out.
