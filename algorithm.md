Let's dive into a structured preparation for the software development skills required for the NUS ICT assessment, focusing on regex, pointers, arrays, hash tables, trees, and search/sorting algorithms.

 ### Regular Expressions (Regex)
   - Definition: A sequence of characters that forms a search pattern, often used for string searching and manipulation.
   - Key Concepts:
     - Anchors: `^` (start), `$` (end).
     - Character classes: `\d` (digit), `\w` (word character), `.` (any character), `\s` (whitespace).
     - Quantifiers: `*` (0 or more), `+` (1 or more), `{n,m}` (between n and m occurrences).
   - Common Use Cases:
     - Validating email addresses, phone numbers, dates.
     - Extracting specific patterns from text (e.g., URLs, postal codes).
   - Example:
     ```regex
     ^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$  // Validates a Social Security Number (SSN)
     ```

 ### Pointers (C/C++ Focus)
   - Definition: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
   - Key Concepts:
     - Pointer declaration: `int *ptr;`
     - Dereferencing: Access the value at the address: `*ptr`.
     - Pointer arithmetic: Navigate through memory (`ptr + 1` moves to the next memory location).
     - Null pointer: `nullptr` is used to initialize a pointer to nothing.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int var = 10;
     int *ptr = &var;  // ptr stores the address of var
     cout << *ptr;  // Outputs the value at the address, i.e., 10
     ```

### Arrays: Key Concepts
   - Definition: A collection of elements (typically of the same data type) stored in contiguous memory locations.
     Here are some key notes based on the questions and concepts discussed about arrays:



1. **Definition**: 
   - An array is a collection of elements (typically of the same data type) stored in contiguous memory locations.

2. **Characteristics**:
   - **Fixed Size**: In most programming languages, arrays have a fixed size defined at the time of declaration.
   - **Indexing**: Elements are accessed by their index, starting from 0.
   - **Multidimensional Arrays**: Arrays can have more than one dimension (e.g., `int matrix[3][3];`), allowing storage of multiple values in a single variable.

### Common Array Functions and Their Uses

1. **`push()`**:
   - **Usage**: Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     const fruits = [];
     fruits.push("banana", "apple"); // fruits = ["banana", "apple"]
     ```

2. **`pop()`**:
   - **Usage**: Removes and returns the last element of the array.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     const fruits = ["banana", "apple"];
     fruits.pop(); // returns "apple", fruits = ["banana"]
     ```

3. **`shift()`**:
   - **Usage**: Removes and returns the first element of an array.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     const fruits = ["banana", "apple"];
     fruits.shift(); // returns "banana", fruits = ["apple"]
     ```

4. **`unshift()`**:
   - **Usage**: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     const fruits = ["apple"];
     fruits.unshift("banana"); // fruits = ["banana", "apple"]
     ```

5. **`map()`**:
   - **Usage**: Creates a new array by applying a function to every element in the original array.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
     const doubled = numbers.map(x => x * 2); // doubled = [2, 4, 6]
     ```

6. **`filter()`**:
   - **Usage**: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
     const evens = numbers.filter(x => x % 2 === 0); // evens = [2, 4]
     ```

7. **`reduce()`**:
   - **Usage**: Executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
     const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0); // sum = 10
     ```

8. **`find()`**:
   - **Usage**: Returns the first element that satisfies the provided testing function.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
     const found = numbers.find(x => x > 2); // found = 3
     ```

9. **`indexOf()`**:
   - **Usage**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in the array, or -1 if it is not found.
   - **Example**: 
     ```javascript
     const fruits = ["banana", "apple", "peach"];
     const index = fruits.indexOf("apple"); // index = 1
     ```

10. **`splice()`**:
    - **Usage**: Can remove or replace existing elements and/or add new elements in place.
    - **Example**: 
      ```javascript
      const fruits = ["banana", "apple", "peach"];
      fruits.splice(1, 1, "orange"); // fruits = ["banana", "orange", "peach"]
      ```

11. **`slice()`**:
    - **Usage**: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array without modifying the original array.
    - **Example**: 
      ```javascript
      const fruits = ["banana", "apple", "peach"];
      const sliced = fruits.slice(1, 2); // sliced = ["apple"]
      ```

### Summary
Arrays are powerful data structures that allow for organized storage of multiple values. Understanding array methods is essential for effective data manipulation and retrieval in programming. Each method serves distinct purposes and can greatly simplify coding tasks.
   - Key Concepts:
     - Fixed size: Arrays in most languages have a fixed size, defined at the time of declaration.
     - Indexing: Elements are accessed by their index, starting from 0.
     - Multidimensional arrays: Arrays with more than one dimension, e.g., `int matrix[3][3];`.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
     cout << arr[2];  // Outputs 3
     ```

 ## Hash Tables (Hash Maps)
   - Definition: A data structure that stores key-value pairs, optimized for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion.
   - Key Concepts:
     - Hash function: Converts a key into an index in the table.
     - Collision handling: Techniques such as chaining or open addressing handle cases where two keys hash to the same index.
     - Time complexity: Average time complexity for operations is O(1).
   - Example (Python):
     ```python
     hash_map = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2}
     print(hash_map["apple"])  # Outputs 1
     ```

## Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
   - Definition: A hierarchical data structure where each node has a value, and links to two or more child nodes (in binary trees, each node has at most two children).
   - Binary Search Tree (BST): A type of binary tree where the left child is smaller than the parent, and the right child is larger.
   - Traversal methods:
     - In-order traversal (left, root, right) yields nodes in increasing order.
     - Pre-order traversal (root, left, right) visits nodes in depth-first order.
     - Post-order traversal (left, right, root).
   - Example (BST insert):
     ```cpp
     struct Node {
         int data;
         Node* left;
         Node* right;
     };
     
     Node* insert(Node* node, int data) {
         if (node == nullptr) {
             node = new Node();
             node->data = data;
             node->left = node->right = nullptr;
         } else if (data < node->data) {
             node->left = insert(node->left, data);
         } else {
             node->right = insert(node->right, data);
         }
         return node;
     }
     ```

 6. Search and Sorting Algorithms
   - Search Algorithms:
     - Linear Search: Search each element sequentially. Time complexity: O(n).
     - Binary Search: Efficient for sorted arrays; repeatedly divides the search space in half. Time complexity: O(log n).
   - Sorting Algorithms:
     - Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Time complexity: O(nÂ²).
     - Merge Sort: Divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array and merges sorted halves. Time complexity: O(n log n).
     - Quick Sort: Partition-based sort that works by selecting a pivot and recursively sorting subarrays. Time complexity: O(n log n).
   - Example (Binary Search):
     ```cpp
     int binarySearch(int arr[], int left, int right, int x) {
         while (left <= right) {
             int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
             if (arr[mid] == x) return mid;
             else if (arr[mid] < x) left = mid + 1;
             else right = mid - 1;
         }
         return -1;
     }
     ```
