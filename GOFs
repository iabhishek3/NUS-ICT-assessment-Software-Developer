Here's a quick cheat sheet summarizing the key GoF design patterns from the questions:

1. **Creational Patterns**:
   - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
   - **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying their exact class.
   - **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related or dependent objects.
   - **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step.
   - **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying existing ones.

2. **Structural Patterns**:
   - **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
   - **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
   - **Proxy**: Controls access to an object.
   - **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**:
   - **Mediator**: Facilitates communication between objects.
   - **Observer**: Notifies interested parties of state changes.
   - **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects.
   - **State**: Changes an object’s behavior based on its state.
   - **Strategy**: Chooses an algorithm at runtime.
   - **Visitor**: Allows operations on different object types without changing their classes.
   - **Iterator**: Traverses a collection without exposing its structure.
   - **Memento**: Restores an object’s state without violating encapsulation.
